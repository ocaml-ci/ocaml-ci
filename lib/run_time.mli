type timestamps =
    Queued of float
  | Running of { ready : float; started : float; }
  | Finished of { ready : float; started : float option; finished : float; }
  (** Type to encode the timestamps of a step or a build. All floats represent
      Unix epoch time - i.e. milliseconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT

      The step or build is either:
      - Queued - the associated timestamp indicates when it was ready to run (enqueued)
      - Running - with timestamps for when it was ready and when it started
      - Finished - with timestamps for when it was ready, when it started and when it finished.
      Note that it may never run -- it may be cancelled or it may timeout. *)

type run_time_info =
    Cached
  | Queued_for of float
  | Running of { queued_for : float; ran_for : float; }
  | Finished of { queued_for : float; ran_for : float option; }
  (** Type to encode the durations of the various stages of a step or build.
      All floats represent milliseconds.

      The step or build is either:
      - Cached - a previously run instance of the step was used and nothing was run
      - Queued - the associated duration represents the number of milliseconds it has been queued for (relative to now)
      - Running - has a queued_for duration, and a ran_for duration. The latter should be interpreted as the number of
      milliseconds that it has been running for
      - Finished - has a queued_for and an optional ran_for duration. The ran_for duration will be None when it did
      not run. *)
